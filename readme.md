# 5. K-Means Clustering (From Scratch)

Learn: broadcasting + vector math
Implement K-means yourself:

Randomly initialize centroids

Compute distances to centroids

Assign clusters

Recompute means

Iterate

Why good: you build a real ML algorithm only with NumPy.

# 6. Linear Regression (From Scratch)

Learn: matrix calculus
Implement:

Closed-form solution using w = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy

Gradient descent version

Compare results

Why good: teaches vectorization + performance thinking.

# 7. Neural Network From Scratch

Learn: high-level math + vectorization
Build a 2-layer NN:

Forward pass

Activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU)

Backpropagation using derivatives

Train on MNIST (or a small dataset)

Why good: deep understanding of how ML works under the hood.

# 8. Sudoku Solver

Learn: logical indexing, np.where
Steps:

Represent board as a 9×9 array

Find empty cells

Check valid numbers using vector checks

Backtracking search

Optional: use vectorized checks for speed

Why good: logical operations + slicing.

✅ Advanced NumPy Mastery Projects
# 9. Build a CPU-Optimized Vector Library

Learn: performance optimization
Implement:

Your own dot product

Your own cosine similarity

Benchmark them against NumPy

Try using vectorized and non-vectorized forms

Why good: teaches how NumPy gets its speed.

# 10. Simulate a Real Physical System (Like N-Body Simulation)

Learn: broadcasting, multidimensional arrays
Simulate gravitational bodies:

Positions = arrays

Velocities = arrays

Forces = pairwise distance computations

Why good: real-world physics + heavy numerical computation.
